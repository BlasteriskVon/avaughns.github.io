                    <p class="bio one">My name is Andrew Vaughns. I am currently a student 
                        in the UNC Coding Bootcamp. I did not initially plan on working in web development but after taking a few courses I
                        have found myself interested in this field. My favorite languages so far from the course are HTML, in conjunction with CSS and 
                        Javascript. My overall favorite language is likely Visual Basic for Applications in Excel due to the fun macros that can be created. (And, if 
                        my workplace involves using Excel, can be a fun way to practice while remaining productive!)

                        I am a graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with a major in mathematics. While I do love math, I also grew a fondness for
                        computer science that I was unable to pursue prior to graduating. My goals for this course include becoming more familiar with the processes surrounding
                        the applications and softwares I use daily.
